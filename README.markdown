Welcome to the Aust CMS.

Aust takes a different approach to content management. It leaves you
to decide how build your site, be it in PHP, Ruby, Python. You can also
build your page using only HTML/Javascript. To load your contents, all you have to
do is read from a JSON API.

If you need help, see the Wiki on Github for videos and tutorials.
